# About Tailscale

Tailscale is a free and open source service, based on WireGuardÂ®, that helps users build no-hassle virtual private networks. With a Tailscale network (tailnet), you can securely access services and devices on that tailnet from anywhere in the world. Tailnets can include anything from a Digital Ocean droplet to a Raspberry Pi, home security camera, or even a Steam Deck. You can share nodes with friends or co-workers, or even expose ports to the public internet with Tailscale Funnel.
