# Enable Funnel

In order to allow local services to be exposed externally with this extension, Funnel needs to be enabled. This is done in the [admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls/file) under Access Controls.

For more information about Funnel, refer to the [Tailscale documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/tailscale-funnel/).
